# ðŸš€ HayDay Chat System â€“ Production Checklist

This checklist summarises the hardening work that was completed to prepare the chat service for deployment.

## âœ… Infrastructure & Security
- Environment variables are now managed through `.env` (see `.env.example`). No secrets are committed to the repository.
- Chat transcripts, analytics and admin sessions persist in an append-only JSON log stored under `data/` with atomic writes and per-file locking to prevent corruption.
- Admin session tokens are randomly generated, SHA-256 hashed before storage and expire after 24 hours. Bearer tokens are required on every admin API call.
- `.gitignore` excludes `.env` files, database artifacts and other transient files.

## âœ… Application Enhancements
- Express server reads the knowledge base from `knowledge-base.json` with safe fallbacks if the file is missing.
- `/api/chat/send` writes messages and analytics counters into the database and reuses the stored timestamps for clients.
- `/api/chat/history` and `/api/chat/poll` stream data directly from the database for consistent pagination.
- `/api/admin/dashboard` surfaces aggregated analytics and active conversation summaries from the new persistence layer.
- Telegram `/webhook/telegram` statistics rely on live analytics data.

## âœ… Quality Gates
- `npm run lint` runs Node's syntax checker across the backend and data store modules.
- `npm test` executes a Node test runner suite that exercises chat flow and admin protection over HTTP.
- `npm run build` now runs both linting and tests for CI/CD pipelines.

## âœ… Deployment Notes
- Render deployments can mount or persist the `data/` directory; alternatively set `DATABASE_PATH` to an external volume path.
- Health monitoring endpoint (`/ping`) returns environment, uptime and dependency status for uptime checks.
- `render.yaml` and README instructions updated to reflect the new setup.

## ðŸ”„ Operational Recommendations
- Rotate OpenAI and Telegram credentials regularly and keep them out of version control.
- Schedule periodic database backups if long-term transcript retention is required.
- Monitor log output (`LOG_LEVEL=info` by default) and adjust as necessary for production.

Everything above has been implemented in this repository so the service can be deployed without leaking credentials or relying on fragile JSON files.
